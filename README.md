# SQL Update and Delete Lab

Now that you've learned how to update and delete data from a table, let's practice.

## Objectives

1. Practice updating data in a table using WHERE clauses
2. Practice deleting data from a table through WHERE clauses

## Todo

Pass the few specs by writing your SQL statements in `lib/update.sql` and `lib/delete.sql`. The data you'll see in the `lib/insert.sql` should be familiar from the last lab.
